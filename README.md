# Identity-Angular-API

A simple study app consisting of an Identity project that allows authentication
to the back-end API and processes the data it retrieves and stores through 
an Angular front-end UI.

# Identity
This app uses Duende in order to benefit from Identity and OpenId. The user data syncs with a MariaDb database.

# APIs
The back-end relies on MariaDb for storing data.
MongoDb has its dedicated API, while uses the Docker image from Docker itself.
All the data can be exported or imported through the Google Sheet API on online spreadsheets.

# Frontend
A simple SPA Angular application.
